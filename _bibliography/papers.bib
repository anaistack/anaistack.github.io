  abstract = {We describe a system for the CWI-task that includes information on 5 aspects of the (complex) lexical item, namely distributional information of the item itself, morphological structure, psychological measures, corpus-counts and topical information. We constructed a deep learning architecture that combines those features and apply it to the probabilistic and binary classification task for all English sets and Spanish. We achieved reasonable performance on all sets with best performances seen on the probabilistic task, particularly on the English news set (MAE 0.054 and F1-score of 0.872). An analysis of the results shows that reasonable performance can be achieved with a single architecture without any domain-specific tweaking of the parameter settings and that distributional features capture almost all of the information also found in hand-crafted features.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new parallel corpus addressed to researchers, teachers, and speech therapists interested in text simplification as a means of alleviating difficulties in children learning to read. The corpus is composed of excerpts drawn from 79 authentic literary (tales, stories) and scientific (documentary) texts commonly used in French schools for children aged between 7 to 9 years old. The excerpts were manually simplified at the lexical, morpho-syntactic, and discourse levels in order to propose a parallel corpus for reading tests and for the development of automatic text simplification tools. A sample of 21 poor-reading and dyslexic children with an average reading delay of 2.5 years read a portion of the corpus. The transcripts of readings errors were integrated into the corpus with the goal of identifying lexical difficulty in the target population. By means of statistical testing, we provide evidence that the manual simplifications significantly reduced reading errors, highlighting that the words targeted for simplification were not only well-chosen but also substituted with substantially easier alternatives. The entire corpus is available for consultation through a web interface and available on demand for research purposes.},

Designing an AI teacher test is challenging: although evaluation methods are much-needed, there is no off-the-shelf solution to measuring pedagogical ability.
This paper reports on a first attempt at an AI teacher test.
We built a solution around the insight that you can run conversational agents in parallel to human teachers in real-world dialogues, simulate how different agents would respond to a student, and compare these counterpart responses in terms of three abilities: speak like a teacher, understand a student, help a student.
Our method builds on the reliability of comparative judgments in education and uses a probabilistic model and Bayesian sampling to infer estimates of pedagogical ability.
We find that, even though conversational agents (Blender in particular) perform well on conversational uptake, they are quantifiably worse than real teachers on several pedagogical dimensions, especially with regard to helpfulness (Blender: Δ ability = -0.75; GPT-3: Δ ability = -0.93).

In essence, the lexicon informs us about what kind of vocabulary should be understood when reading Dutch as a non-native reader at a particular proficiency level. The main novelty of the resource with respect to the previously developed CEFR-graded lexicons concerns the introduction of corpus-based evidence for L2 word sense complexity through the linkage to Open Dutch WordNet (Postma et al., 2016). The resource thus contains, on top of the lemmatised and part-of-speech tagged lexical entries, a total of 11,999 unique word senses and 8,934 distinct synsets.},

  abstract = {Cognate vocabulary is known to have a facilitating effect on foreign language (L2) lexical development (de Groot and Keijzer, 2000; Elgort, 2013). Because of their cross-lingual semiotic transparency, cognates are known to be easier to comprehend and learn. As a result, cognate status has been considered an important feature when modeling L2 vocabulary learning (Willis and Ohashi, 2012) or when assessing L2 lexical readability (Beinborn et al., 2014). Although the latter readability-focused user study has shown a positive effect of cognates on decontextualized word comprehension, not many studies seem to have focused on how cognate vocabulary is distributed in reading texts of different L2 levels, such as reading materials found in textbooks graded along the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference) scale (Council of Europe, 2001). Our aim is therefore to examine whether the presupposed increasing difficulty of the lexical stock attested in such texts is somehow related to cognate density. To this end, we will focus on French and Dutch L2 and will use two lexical databases, viz. FLELex (Francois et al., 2014) and NT2Lex (Tack et al., 2018), respectively. These resources have been compiled from a corpus of L2 reading materials targeted towards a specific CEFR level, including expert-written texts found in textbooks or readers. The lexicons thus describe word frequency distributions observed along the CEFR scale and therefore inform us about the lexical stock that should be understood a priori at a given level. In these CEFR-graded word distributions, cognate vocabulary in Dutch and French will be automatically identified, drawing on recent machine translation methods (Beinborn et al., 2013; Mitkov et al., 2007). As a parallel reference dataset, we will use the Dutch-French alignments of the Dutch Parallel Corpus (Paulussen et al., 2006).}
