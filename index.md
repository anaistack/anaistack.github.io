Hi there!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher interested in the application of natural language processing and machine learning in educational technologies for language learners.

My work focuses on the development and evaluation of automated methods (statistical and deep learning) and machine-readable resources (graded lexicons) for the identification of linguistic complexity and difficulty in natural language texts.

Several resources that I developed are available open access under a Creative Commons license, such as the [CEFR-ASAG dataset](https://github.com/anaistack/cefr-asag-corpus) and the [NT2Lex resource](https://github.com/anaistack/NT2Lex).
